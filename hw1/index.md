## Homework 1

All of my javascript code for this project is based off of a demo made by mozilla which you can find [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/webgl-examples/gh-pages/tutorial/sample5/webgl-demo.js). The code is from a tutorial which you can find [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Creating_3D_objects_using_WebGL). I've made diffs of all of the javascript files I made with the demo so that you can easily see what work is mine. The diffs are in the folder for each page (you can see the folder by clicking view source on each page)
