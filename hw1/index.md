## Homework 1

All of my javascript code for this project is based off of a demo made by mozilla which you can find [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/webgl-examples/gh-pages/tutorial/sample5/webgl-demo.js). The code is from a tutorial which you can find [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Creating_3D_objects_using_WebGL). When I'm ready to turn in this assignment, I'll put diffs of all of the javascript files I made with the demo so that you can easily see what work is mine.

## Shapes

- [Tetrahedron](tetrahedron/)
- [Cube](cube/)
